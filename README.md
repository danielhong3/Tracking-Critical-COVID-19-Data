# Tracking-Critical-COVID-19-Data
Recently Johns Hopkins updated their Corona Resource website with a few interactive graphs to track cases over time across the entire world. However, the data visualization animation shows the total number of cases reported in each country irregardless of the recovery rate. In this project, our goal is to visualize the toll of Covid-19 while also keeping track of how well it is being managed in the US.

# Data Visualization 
The first data visualization is a bubble graph overlayed onto the US that shows the number of confirmed cases across the entire United states. The more the cases, the larger the bubble.

This next graph is a heatmap showing the total number of Covid-related deaths across the entire united states. This only tells us the deaths within these respective areas and is reflective of the intensity of the spread in certain areas.

Next, is another heatmap showing the total number of Covid recoveries across the US. This, when compared with the death heatmap above, shows which areas did the best at managing the disease after it had spread.

Lastly, we have a timeline heatmap that shows the spread of COVID over time across the entire US

#Conclusion
All in all, python is a powerful tool for visualizing the spread of corona, how impactful it was on certain regions, and how well each region respectively handled the spread. The timeline graph is also capable of showing just how quickly the disease spread over short periods of time.
